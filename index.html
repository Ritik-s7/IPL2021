              team served a two-year suspension from the IPL starting July 2015
              due to the involvement of their owners in the 2013 IPL betting
              case, and won the title in its comeback season of 2018. The team
              is captained by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coached by Stephen
              Fleming. The Super Kings have won the IPL title thrice (in 2010,
              2011 and 2018), and have the highest win percentage of matches
              among all teams in the IPL (59.83%). They hold the records of most
              appearances in the playoffs (ten) and the Final (eight) of the
              IPL. In addition, they have also won the Champions League Twenty20
              in 2010 and 2014. The brand value of the Super Kings in 2019 is
              estimated to be around ₹732 crore (roughly $104 million), making
              them one of the most valuable IPL franchise.

              Bangalore by 31 runs in the final. The team won the double by
              winning its first IPL title, in 2013, by defeating Chennai Super
              Kings by 23 runs in the final, and then defeated the Rajasthan
              Royals by 33 runs to win its second Champions League Twenty20
              title later that year. They won their second IPL title on 24 May

              first team to win three IPL titles. While playing the tournament,
              they won their 100th T20, becoming the first team to do so. In
              2019, they repeated the same feat as they won a record breaking
              fourth IPL title, by beating CSK by just 1 run on 12 May 2019 in
              the IPL Final. They became the first team to win the IPL title for
              the fifth time, by beating Delhi Capitals by 5 wickets on 10
              November 2020 in the IPL Final.

              cricket team based in Jaipur, Rajasthan, that plays in the Indian
              Premier League (IPL). Founded in 2008 as one of the initial eight
              IPL franchises, the team is based at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in
              Jaipur. The Royals are known to unearth obscure, high potential
              talent, as well as for their involvement in a number of
              controversies and scandals. The team won the inaugural edition of
              the IPL under the captaincy of Shane Warne, despite being written
              off as a title contender by the media and fans. The Royals were
              also the runners-up of the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 under
              Rahul Dravid's captaincy. On 14 July 2015, the verdict reached by
              a panel appointed by the Supreme Court of India suspended
              Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings for two years over a 2013
              betting scandal, meaning they could not participate in both the
              2016 and 2017 IPL tournaments. They returned to the competition
              for the 2018 season. The team's record run-scorer is Ajinkya
              Rahane with 3098 runs, while the leading wicket-taker is Shane
              Watson, with 67. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)
              announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in
              September 2007, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.[14]
              The Rajasthan Royals were one of the original eight teams in the
              inaugural season of the IPL in 2008. Emerging Media gained
              ownership of the Jaipur-based franchise team with a bid of $67
              million, making it the least expensive team in the league.

              India, that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The
              franchise is owned by Kalanithi Maran of the SUN Group and was
              founded in 2012 after the Hyderabad-based Deccan Chargers were
              terminated by the IPL. The team is currently captained by Kane
              Williamson and coached by Trevor Bayliss. Their primary home
              ground is the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium,
              Hyderabad, which has capacity of 55,000. The team made their first
              IPL appearance in 2013, where they reached the playoffs,
              eventually finishing in fourth place. The Sunrisers won their
              maiden IPL title in the 2016 season, defeating the Royal
              Challengers Bangalore by 8 runs in the final. The team has
              qualified for the play-off stage of the tournament in every season
              since 2016. In 2018, the team reached the finals of the Indian
              Premier League, but lost to Chennai Super Kings. The team is
              considered one of the best bowling sides, often admired for its
              ability to defend low totals. David Warner is the leading run
              scorer for the side, having won the Orange Cap 3 times, in 2015,
              2017, and 2019. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is the leading wicket-taker. The
              COVID-19 pandemic impacted the brand value of the Sunrisers
              Hyderabad which saw a decline of 4 percent to US$57.4 million in
              2020 as the overall brand value of the IPL decreased to US$4.4
              billion, according to Brand Finance.

              Mohali. Since 2010, they also have been playing some of their home

              Punjab Kings in February 2021. In 2007, the Board of Control for
              Cricket in India (BCCI) created the cricket tournament the Indian
              Premier League, based on the Twenty20 format of the game.
              Franchises for eight cities were made available in an auction held
              in Mumbai on 20 February 2008. The team representing Punjab was
              bought by the Dabur group's Mohit Burman (46%), the Wadia group's
              Ness Wadia (23%), Preity Zinta (23%), and Saptarshi Dey of the Dey
              & Dey Group (minor stake). The group paid a total of $76 million
              to acquire the franchise.
