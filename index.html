              team served a two-year suspension from the IPL starting July 2015
              due to the involvement of their owners in the 2013 IPL betting
              case, and won the title in its comeback season of 2018. The team
              is captained by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coached by Stephen
              Fleming. The Super Kings have won the IPL title thrice (in 2010,
              2011 and 2018), and have the highest win percentage of matches
              among all teams in the IPL (59.83%). They hold the records of most
              appearances in the playoffs (ten) and the Final (eight) of the
              IPL. In addition, they have also won the Champions League Twenty20
              in 2010 and 2014. The brand value of the Super Kings in 2019 is
              estimated to be around ₹732 crore (roughly $104 million), making
              them one of the most valuable IPL franchise.

              Since its establishment, the team has played its home matches in

              Bangalore by 31 runs in the final. The team won the double by
              winning its first IPL title, in 2013, by defeating Chennai Super
              Kings by 23 runs in the final, and then defeated the Rajasthan
              Royals by 33 runs to win its second Champions League Twenty20
              title later that year. They won their second IPL title on 24 May
              2015 by defeating the Chennai Super Kings by 41 runs in the final
              and became the third team to win more than one IPL title. On 21
              May 2017, they won their third IPL title by defeating the Rising
              Pune Supergiant by 1 run in a thrilling final, thus becoming the
              first team to win three IPL titles. While playing the tournament,
              they won their 100th T20, becoming the first team to do so. In
              2019, they repeated the same feat as they won a record breaking
              fourth IPL title, by beating CSK by just 1 run on 12 May 2019 in
              the IPL Final. They became the first team to win the IPL title for
              the fifth time, by beating Delhi Capitals by 5 wickets on 10
              November 2020 in the IPL Final.
